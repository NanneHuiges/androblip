AndroBlip
==============

Background
--------------
Androblip is an android application for blipfoto.com. The first version was written for Android 1.5, 
justto make uploading images possible. When blipfoto released their own official app, new users
and interest went down.

At this moment, a new version of the API was released, and AndroBlip needed some love. It was either
throw away or start over. Throw away would be sad, so the least I could do was make the source available.
And then I started some rewriting anyway, as it wasn't (and probably still is) not very clear what
all this does.

Usage
---------------
 - Create yourself a developer account and get an API key and secret.
 - Copy the Settings.java.template to Settings.java and fill them in
 - Make changes, test and commit
 - do a pull request!

Code remarks, feature requests, discussion, are all welcome!
